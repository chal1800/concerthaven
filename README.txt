# concerthaven

The core idea of our project is to build a web application through which the users can find concerts in Copenhagen. In order to provide a structured user flow, we decided to include the sign up and log-in functions. To narrow down and personalize the search results, the system includes various filter functions, which are: genre, time range, ticket price and distance. The main purpose of the application is then to show the user the concerts that match his/her filtered criteria or direct search.
Differently from the initial concept, the geo-location feature will be rather static than dynamic, meaning the user selects from a pre-defined list of three locations in Copenhagen. This will allow us to concentrate on the development of filter functions instead of the advanced dynamic geo-location.
